# 202005251132 Zettlekasten Note Taking

#knowledge #productivity

The Zettelkasten method from Niklas Luhmann for taking notes and linking them together. The idea is to capture atomic ideas and have a way of linking them.

## Principles

 1. Atomicity - each note one idea
 2. Autonomy - self contained and understandable standing alone
 3. Every noted is linked to another note
 4. Each link is explained
 5. Use your own words - no copy and paste
 6. Keep references so you know where the idea came from
 7. Add your own thoughts to the list
 8. Don't worry about structure - 
 9. Add connection notes - ones who's purpose is to link ideas together
 10. Add outline notes - like connection notes, but ones with a sequence to create a story
 11. Never delete - update with reasons why things have changed
 12. Add without fear - don't stop to question, just add it
